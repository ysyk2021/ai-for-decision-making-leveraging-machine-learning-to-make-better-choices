AI-driven decision making has the potential to transform organizations and improve outcomes. However, it is essential to ensure that ethical and unbiased decision-making practices are in place to prevent harm and ensure fairness. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of managing ethics and bias in AI-driven decision making.

Understanding Ethics in AI-Driven Decision Making

Ethics in AI-driven decision making refers to ensuring that decisions made by AI algorithms align with ethical principles and values. This includes ensuring that decisions are fair, transparent, and accountable. It also involves considering the impact of decisions on stakeholders and society as a whole.

Addressing Bias in AI-Driven Decision Making

Bias in AI-driven decision making occurs when the algorithms used to make decisions reflect the biases of those who created them or the data they were trained on. This can result in unfair and discriminatory decisions. Addressing bias requires identifying and mitigating sources of bias in data collection, algorithm development, and decision-making processes.
